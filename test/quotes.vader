Given cpp:
  #include "stream"
  int main() {
    ;
    return 0;
  }

Do:
# Clear out a trailing quote
  $x
# Auto append it
  a.h\<C-S>

Expect cpp (Modified end of include string):
  #include "stream.h"
  int main() {
    ;
    return 0;
  }

Do:
# Add a new quoted string
  2jIchar* c = "name\<C-S>

Expect cpp (Added new quoted string):
  #include "stream"
  int main() {
    char* c = "name";
    return 0;
  }



Given python:
  s = "stream"
  def main():
    pass

Do:
# Clear out a trailing quote
  $x
# Auto append it
  a.h\<C-S>

Expect python (Modified end of string):
  s = "stream.h"
  def main():
    pass

Do:
# Add a new quoted string
  2j0wCreturn s == 'bream\<C-S>

Expect python (Added new quoted string):
  s = "stream"
  def main():
    return s == 'bream'



Given clojure (Lots of braces):
  (defn say-hello
    ([] (println "Hello there"))
    ([name] (println (str "Hello " name))))

Do:
# Clear out some trailing quote and braces
  j2f"D
# Auto append them
  a\<C-S>

Expect clojure (Added a quote):
  (defn say-hello
    ([] (println "Hello there"
    ([name] (println (str "Hello " name))))

Do:
# Clear out some trailing quote and braces
  j2f"DF]x
# Auto append them
  iunused\<C-S>\<Esc>$a\<C-S>\<Esc>a\<C-S>\<Esc>a\<C-S>

# Workaround junegunn/vader.vim#38: Add extra Esc.
Expect clojure (WORKAROUND: Added a quote and braces):
  (defn say-hello
    ([unused] (println "Hello there"))
    ([name] (println (str "Hello " name))))
